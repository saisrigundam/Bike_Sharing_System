# Bike_Sharing_System
Bike-sharing systems permit people to borrow and return a bike from a bike station to another station that belongs to the same network. Currently there are around 500 bike-sharing companies around the world. Our goal in this project is to understand and predict daily bike rentals using linear regression.
